Tau-ceti is the best planet for a family vacation or just a nice relaxed visit. Even though it doesn’t have the wild life of a Cyan-44b or the trippy vibe that Velvet surprise has,
<br>
 it still has plenty to offer. The cities are bigger and more evolved than anything earth has to offer.
 <br>
Plenty of intelligent life in habits the planet and they are very accepting of humans. All the aliens are very peaceful and has gathered from all over the galaxy, therefor it’s very
<br>
 safe. The food and culture are both a completely unique experience. The weather is hot, and the atmosphere is easily breathable by humans but other humanoid species will have no problem.
