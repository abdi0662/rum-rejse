Cyan-44b is for the people who enjoy connecting with the wild. Millions of species wander this jungle covered planet.<br> A lot has already been discovered but there are believed to be many more so there is a great chance you can find new ones.<br> The planet is protected from hunters and you will be punished if you decide to do it, so remember to bring lots of food.<br> 
There will be an opportunity to get a tour guide to show you around the different landmarks and locations.<br> There are lots of places to camp out but there are also hotels if you don’t want to sleep under the stars. <br> Unlike Tau-ceti the air is not human friendly because there is to much oxygen.<br> Therefore, it’s very important you remember your oxygenchip.
